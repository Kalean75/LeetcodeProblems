The Brute force Solution is achieved by using a nested for loop, with the outer loop starting at 0 and going to the lenght of the input array, and the inner loop starting at i + 1 and going through the rest of the loop. Once it finds the two indices that sum up to the value, it then breaks and returns these indices.

The optimal solution utilizes a dictionary, and calculates target - nums[i]. if this value is in the dictionary,  it adds the indices and returns the answer. If not, then target - nums[i] is added to the dictionary.
